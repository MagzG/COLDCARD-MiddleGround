## Conclusion
That is all for this guide. You should have the knowledge now to check your tamper-evident bag, setup a PIN, create & backup a seed phrase created with some of your own randomness, as well how to import a watch-only wallet to Sparrow wallet and make some air-gapped transactions, and have some ideas about steel backup solutions. Both COLDCARD and Sparrow Wallet have more advanced features which you can learn about in the [Paranoid](https://www.github.com/econoalchemist/ColdCard-Paranoid/) guide. Be sure to power down your COLDCARD, disconnect it, and secure it in a safe place and keep your backup information in a separate location.
